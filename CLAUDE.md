```

## High-Level Architecture

Agency Swarm is a multi-agent orchestration framework built on top of the OpenAI Agents SDK (v1.x beta). It enables creating collaborative AI agent systems with structured communication flows and full conversation persistence.

### Core Components

1. **Agency** (`agency.py` - 792 lines, needs refactoring)
   - Orchestrates multiple agents using an orchestrator-workers pattern
   - Manages communication flows between agents
   - Provides persistence hooks for conversation history
   - Entry points: `get_response()`, `get_response_stream()` (async)

2. **Agent** (`agent/agent.py` - 1444 lines, needs refactoring)
   - Extends `agents.Agent` from OpenAI SDK
   - Adds file handling, sub-agent registration, and tool management
   - Uses `send_message` tool for inter-agent communication
   - Supports structured outputs via `output_type` parameter

3. **Thread Management** (`thread.py`)
   - `ThreadManager`: Manages conversation threads with persistence
   - `ConversationThread`: Stores complete conversation history
   - Threads are isolated by sender-receiver pairs

4. **Context Sharing** (`context.py`)
   - `MasterContext`: Shared state accessible to all agents
   - Passed through RunHooks system during execution

5. **Tool System** (`tools/`)
   - `BaseTool`: Pydantic-based tool creation (legacy, kept for compatibility)
   - `@function_tool`: Modern decorator-based tool creation (recommended)
   - `SendMessage`: Automatic tool for inter-agent communication

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Communication Flows**
   ```python
   agency = Agency(
       entry_agent,
       communication_flows=[(ceo, developer), (ceo, assistant)]
   )
   ```

2. **Persistence Pattern**
   ```python
   agency = Agency(
       agents,
       load_threads_callback=lambda: load_from_db(),
       save_threads_callback=lambda threads: save_to_db(threads)
   )
   ```

3. **Tool Creation**
   ```python
   # Modern pattern (recommended)
   @function_tool
   def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
       """Tool description."""
       return f"Result: {param}"

   # Legacy pattern (for compatibility)
   class MyTool(BaseTool):
       field: str = Field(..., description="Description")
       def run(self):
           return f"Result: {self.field}"
   ```

## Version Context

- **v1.x**: Beta preview built on OpenAI Agents SDK (Responses API)
- **v0.x**: Production ready (legacy)
- **Breaking changes**: See `docs/migration_guide.mdx`
- **Examples**: Updated for v1.x patterns
- **Documentation**: `/docs/` folder is OUTDATED (v0.x)

## Critical Safety Protocols (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

### Before ANY Code Changes

1. **Build Project Structure First**
   ```bash
   find src/ -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | sort  # Full file inventory
   find src/ -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr      # Check for >500 line violations
   ```

2. **Review ALL Changes**
   ```bash
   git diff --cached | cat  # Review ALL staged changes
   git diff | cat           # Review ALL unstaged changes
   git status --porcelain   # Check all files including untracked
   ```

3. **Run Full Test Suite After EVERY Change**
   ```bash
   make ci                                          # Full pipeline (required)
   python examples/agency_terminal_demo.py          # Basic functionality
   python examples/multi_agent_workflow.py          # Multi-agent communication
   python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v          # Integration tests
   ```

### Refactoring Rules

- **ZERO functional changes allowed during refactoring**
- **Only structural reorganization to reduce file sizes**
- **Preserve ALL behavior, even quirks and bugs**
- **Verify against commit 54491685065bc657c358be3f2899da707e5ed94f**

### Code Quality Requirements

- **Python 3.13 Required**: Use modern type syntax (`str | int | None`)
- **No legacy imports**: Never use `Union`, always use pipe syntax
- **File size limit**: 500 lines maximum (current violations: agency.py, agent.py)
- **Test coverage**: 83% minimum required
- **Integration tests**: Located in `tests/integration/` - NO MOCKS allowed
- **Never write manual test scripts**: Use existing test infrastructure only

### Critical Mission-Critical Codebase Rules

1. **BRUTAL HONESTY REQUIRED**: Always report actual results, even minor issues
2. **SCIENTIFIC APPROACH MANDATORY**: Base ALL decisions on real data, never assumptions
3. **ARCHITECTURAL THINKING FIRST**: Understand ENTIRE system before structural changes
4. **NO STUB FILES**: Never create tiny files that just delegate - minimum 50 lines
5. **SERVICE LAYER ARCHITECTURE**: When splitting files, extract business logic properly

### Mandatory Workflow (NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. **BEFORE ANY TASK**:
   ```bash
   find src/ -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | sort  # Full inventory
   find src/ -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr      # Find violations
   ```

2. **AFTER EVERY CHANGE**:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached | cat  # Review ALL staged changes
   git diff | cat           # Review ALL unstaged changes
   git status --porcelain   # Check ALL files
   ```

3. **PROACTIVE ANALYSIS**:
   - Search for ALL similar patterns
   - Fix all instances at once
   - Never do piecemeal changes

### Zero Functional Changes Protocol

This is the **MOST CRITICAL RULE**. During refactoring:

- **ALLOWED**: Moving code, extracting methods, splitting files
- **FORBIDDEN**: Changing logic, behavior, APIs, error handling
- **PRESERVE**: All bugs, quirks, and weird behavior
- **VERIFY**: Against commit 54491685065bc657c358be3f2899da707e5ed94f

## Domain-Driven Refactoring Plan

### Current State
- `agency.py`: 792 lines (VIOLATES 500 line limit)
- `agent.py`: 1444 lines (VIOLATES 500 line limit)
- Multiple tests failing due to attempted functional changes

### Refactoring Strategy - Domain-Driven Design

The goal is to split large files into focused domains while maintaining exact functionality. This is a suggested approach that should be adapted based on actual code analysis and optimal design decisions.

#### Suggested Domain Boundaries

**For Agent (currently 1444 lines):**
- **Core Domain**: Agent initialization, configuration, tool management
- **Run Domain**: Everything that happens during a run (get_response cycle)
- **Communication Domain**: Inter-agent messaging and subagent registration
- **File Management Domain**: File operations and vector store handling

**For Agency (currently 792 lines):**
- **Core Domain**: Agency initialization and agent orchestration
- **Run Services**: Coordinating agent runs and response handling
- **Registration Services**: Managing agent registration and communication flows
- **Integration Services**: External integrations (FastAPI, demos)
- **Visualization Services**: Structure representation and visualization

**Supporting Domains to Consider:**
- **Context Management**: Shared state and context preparation
- **Streaming**: Event streaming and conversion
- **Persistence**: Thread and state management

#### Design Principles

1. **Domain Cohesion**: Each module should represent a coherent business domain
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Clear boundaries between domains
3. **Flexible Implementation**: Choose the best approach during actual refactoring
4. **Maintain Public API**: External interfaces must remain unchanged

### Critical Rules

1. **ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES**
   - Every method must work EXACTLY as before
   - Preserve ALL bugs and quirks
   - No new features or fixes

2. **Verification Protocol**
   ```bash
   # After EVERY file split
   git diff --cached | cat
   make ci
   python examples/agency_terminal_demo.py
   ```

3. **Test Preservation**
   - DO NOT add new tests during refactoring
   - Existing tests must pass/fail exactly as before
   - Same 8 tests should fail (context sharing + agency chart)

4. **File Size Targets**
   - Maximum: 500 lines (hard limit)
   - Ideal: 300-400 lines
   - Minimum for new files: 50 lines (avoid tiny stubs)

### Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1**: Split agent.py (highest priority - 1444 lines)
2. **Phase 2**: Extract agency services (792 lines)
3. **Phase 3**: Clean up any remaining violations
4. **Phase 4**: Run full validation suite

### What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå Fix any bugs (even obvious ones)
- ‚ùå Add new functionality
- ‚ùå Change any APIs or signatures
- ‚ùå Create stub files < 50 lines
- ‚ùå Mix functional changes with refactoring

# Critical Safety Protocols (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

## üî¥ MANDATORY WORKFLOW PROCESS

### Python Version Requirement
- **PYTHON 3.13 REQUIRED** - This codebase strictly uses Python 3.13 features
- **ULTRA-MODERN TYPE SYNTAX** - Always use the newest type syntax: `str | int | None` never `Union[str, int, None]`
- **NO LEGACY TYPE IMPORTS** - Never import `Union` from typing - use pipe syntax exclusively
- **TYPE ANNOTATIONS MANDATORY** - All function parameters and return values must use modern type hints

### 1. BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK

**üî¥ STEP 0: BUILD PROJECT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY ANALYSIS)**
```bash
find src/ -name "*.py" | grep -v __pycache__ | sort  # Full file inventory
find src/ -name "*.py" | xargs wc -l | sort -nr     # Check for >500 line violations
```

**üî¥ STEP 1: COMPLETE CHANGE REVIEW (MANDATORY)**
```bash
git diff --cached | cat  # MUST review ALL staged changes - NO EXCEPTIONS
git diff | cat           # MUST review ALL unstaged changes - NO EXCEPTIONS
git status --porcelain   # MUST check status of ALL files including untracked
```

**üî¥ STEP 2: PROACTIVE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)**
- **SEARCH for ALL similar patterns** across entire codebase
- **IDENTIFY all related changes** needed
- **CREATE comprehensive plan** for all similar patterns
- **PREVENT piecemeal changes** - fix all instances at once

**üî¥ STEP 3: VALIDATION (MANDATORY)**
```bash
make ci                                          # Full lint + mypy + tests + coverage
python examples/agency_terminal_demo.py          # Basic functionality
python examples/multi_agent_workflow.py          # Multi-agent communication
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v          # Integration tests
```

### Critical Safety Rules
- **NEVER commit major changes** without running tests first
- **NEVER claim "it works"** without actual test execution results
- **ONE LINE CHANGE = FULL TEST SUITE** - no exceptions
- **IMMEDIATELY fix failing tests** - do not proceed with other work
- **NEVER remove error handling** without explicit permission
- **Test ALL code paths** including edge cases before claiming completion

### üö® CRITICAL REFACTORING PROTOCOL - ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES ALLOWED

**üî¥ NUCLEAR-LEVEL SAFETY REQUIREMENT: ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES DURING REFACTORING**

This is the **MOST CRITICAL RULE** in the entire codebase.

#### Refactoring Definition
- **ALLOWED**: Moving code between files, extracting methods, renaming for clarity, splitting large files
- **FORBIDDEN**: Changing ANY logic, behavior, API, return values, error handling, or functionality

#### Mandatory Verification Protocol
1. **BEFORE ANY REFACTOR**: Save complete file contents snapshot
2. **COMPARE LINE-BY-LINE**: Use `git diff` to verify EVERY single change
3. **LOGIC PRESERVATION**: The old code and new code must be FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL
4. **CHECK COMMIT 54491685065bc657c358be3f2899da707e5ed94f**: Verify against this baseline

#### Refactoring Rules
- **ONLY GOAL**: Reduce file sizes below 500 lines
- **NO NEW FEATURES**: Zero additions to functionality
- **NO BUG FIXES**: Even if you spot bugs, DO NOT fix them during refactoring
- **PRESERVE ALL QUIRKS**: Even weird behavior must be preserved exactly

### Git Best Practices (20 Years of Experience)
- **ALWAYS use `git status --porcelain`** to check all files including untracked
- **NEVER use `git reset --hard`** without first saving important changes
- **MODEL CAUSALITY THOROUGHLY** before any git operation
- **Group commits logically** - separate refactoring from bug fixes from features
- **Write descriptive commit messages** that explain the WHY, not just the WHAT

### File & Method Limits
- **Max 500 lines per file** - Current violators: `agency.py` (437 lines - OK), `agent.py` (1335 lines - MUST refactor)
- **Max 100 lines per method/function** - Prefer 10-40 lines
- **Single responsibility** per class/function
- **DRY Principle: 3+ repetitions = immediate refactoring**

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
ALWAYS model causality thoroughly before acting - understand what each command will do and its consequences.
